# Beer Run

This is a small Three.js browser game written in TypeScript. The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and building.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> in your browser to see the game.

## Building

To build a production version that can be hosted anywhere as static files:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder. You can upload these files to any static host or share them directly.
